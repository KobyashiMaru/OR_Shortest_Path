# These code is being use of finding the shortest path for a cleaning robot.

1. If we know where all the obstacles are, there must exist a path which is the shortest,
    finding it by using Deep-First Search algorithm of graph theory.
    
2. Then we improved frame rate to make it look smoothly.

3. Because of grids around obstacles is calculated differently, there will be 1 pixel tolerance that we can't fix.

4. In order to show my work, there is a video for demonstration, it's converted by other programs since the matrices of pictures is too large that my computer can't process.

5. The video is kind of bulr because of using 360*270pix picture making animation.

6. It's possible that bot is placed in any position on the map, we just set top left as initial point for demonstration.
