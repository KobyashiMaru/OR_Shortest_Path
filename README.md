# These code is being use of finding the shortest path for a cleaning robot.

1.If we know where all the obstacles are, there must exist a path which is the shortest,
  finding it by using Deep-First Search algorithm of graph theory.

2.Then we improved th frame rate to make it look smoothly.

3.Because of grids around obstacles is calculate differently, there will be 1 pixel tolerance that we can't fix.
