# These code is being use of finding the shortest path for a cleaning robot.

<h2 style="color:blue;">This is programmed by 洪浚皓＆陳博允</h2>


1. If we know where all the obstacles are, there must exist a path which is the shortest,
    finding it by using Deep-First Search algorithm of graph theory.
    
2. Then we improved th frame rate to make it look smoothly.

3. Because of grids around obstacles is calculated differently, there will be 1 pixel tolerance that we can't fix.
